# Creating a record
{: .no_toc }

AcceptEasy knows two kinds of records: bills and mandates. A bill can be paid by the recipient to receive goods or services. A mandate is a special type of bill in which the recipient pays a small fee or first installment for a service he or she will receive. In doing so, he/she gives the sender a mandate to pull a payment from that account for a set or variable amount during a set period.
