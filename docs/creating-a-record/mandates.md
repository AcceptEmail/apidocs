### Sending a mandate through email
When you want to send a mandate through email you will need to POST a JSON object like below to /v2/Mandate:
```
{
  "PaymentReference": "123456",
  "Description": "my description",
  "Address": {
    "Email": "contact@accepteasy.com"
  },
  "SequenceType": "OneOff",
  "ToDate": "2020-05-24T11:10:17.7245913Z",
  "AmountType": "Open",
  "MaximumAmount": 5400,
  "Communication": [
    {
      "Channel": "Email",
      "MessageStatus": "All",
      "MandateStatus": "All"
    }
  ]
}
```

This will result in a request that gives the sender the mandate to make a one-time withdrawal of a maximum of 54 euros, before May 24th 2020.
The [Swagger docs](https://api.acceptemail.com/swagger/ui/index#!/Mandate/Mandate_Post_v2) give a full overview of the different options and statuses.
