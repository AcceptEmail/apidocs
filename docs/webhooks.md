### Receiving webhooks for bounces, asynchronous creation and payment status

Webhooks can be used to get realtime feedback on the status of AcceptEmail transactions. Some examples of our webhooks:

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
Bounce
</div>
```
{
  "ATID": "120b6125-fdfa-4124-a08c-dbf63f38e162",
  "ERROR": null,
  "PaymentReference": "123456",
  "SRRID": "r180205114728321",
  "STATUS": "Bounced"
}
```

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
Creation success
{: .fs-4}
only sent for bills (both sync and async) 
{: .fs-2 .lh-0}
</div>
```
{
  "ATID": "120b6125-fdfa-4124-a08c-dbf63f38e162",
  "ERROR": null,
  "PaymentReference": "123456",
  "SRRID": "r180205114728321",
  "STATUS": "CreationSucceeded"
}
```

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
Creation error
</div>
```
{
  "ATID": "120b6125-fdfa-4124-a08c-dbf63f38e162",
  "ERROR":  {
    "Message": "APP0224 - Expiry date must be in the future."
  },
  "PaymentReference": "123456",
  "SRRID": "r180205114728321",
  "STATUS": "CreationFailed"
}
```

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
Payment made
{: .fs-4}
for both bills and mandates
{: .fs-2 .lh-0 }
</div>
```
{
  "ATID": "120b6125-fdfa-4124-a08c-dbf63f38e162",
  "ERROR": null,
  "PaymentReference": "123456",
  "SRRID": "r180205114728321",
  "STATUS": "Paid"
}
```

These webhooks will be sent to a HTTPS endpoint that can be set in your account. 

<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/254997339' frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

Upon receiving a webhook, for instance, for payment, you can use GET /v2/Bill/[ATID], to fetch additional information such as the account holder name, or account number for the account that completed the payment.

### Retry mechanism for webhooks

For varying reasons (network problems, maintenance, etc.) a webhook may not be received by your system. For this scenario, there is a retry-mechanism. Our application will monitor the response from your system and in case of a timeout or failure retry sending the webhook with increasing time intervals (for a maximum of 10 retries, the first occuring after 15 minutes and the final attempt after 6 days).
You can also enter an email-address where you will be notified if the 1st retry fails. Another email will be sent once the 10th (and final) retry has failed. A maximum of 1 notification-email per day will be sent.

The retry mechanism can be enabled in the settings-page, right below the REST API Notification URL. The email-address can also be filled here.

The full retry mechanism also applies to the Outbound trigger (Legacy).
