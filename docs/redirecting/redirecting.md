# Redirecting
{: .no_toc }

It is possible to redirect a user straight to the payment service provider, effectively skipping our transaction page.
An explanation on how to achieve this can be found [here](redirecting/to-payment-provider).

It is also possible to redirect a user to a page or mobile app after he or she finished a transaction.
An explanation on how to achieve this can be found [here](redirecting/after-payment).
